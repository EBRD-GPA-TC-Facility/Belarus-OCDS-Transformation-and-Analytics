# Belarus-OCDS-Transformation-and-Analytics

## EBRD GPA TC Facility – Support in Accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement of the World Trade Organization. Assignment: Belarus: Public Procurement Reporting Module for the National eProcurement System/s.
<p>

### Description: 
Data is extracted from the existing public procurement platforms, which continue to operate, and transformed to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). This data is consolidated in a single database, and a business intelligence module is run on top of it, accessing the data via an Application Programme Interface (API). This provides government procurement policy makers with a tool to analyse and visualise procurement trends. The data is also made accessible via an open data portal, ensuring transparency of public spending. 

### Project timeline:
2018 – 2019	
### Project status: 
Fully deployed

## Context and problem statement
<p>
As of 2016, The Republic of Belarus was negotiating its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a priority. One element of this is the adoption of the WTO’s Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) – which aims to open Government procurement markets to signatory countries. In order to comply with the GPA, Belarus requested support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (EBRD) GPA Technical Cooperation Facility to help modernise its public procurement system.  
<p>
The Republic of Belarus has several existing, well-functioning electronic public procurement solutions that deliver semi-automated processes. However, these solutions are spread across several different systems and organisations:
  
*	A public procurement marketplace operated by the National Centre of Marketing 
*	A public procurement marketplace operated by the Belarusian Universal Commodity Exchange 
*	A publication centre for procurement information (purchases made) operated by the National Centre of Marketing. This publication centre publishes procurement data generated through both of the marketplaces mentioned above.
<p>
A separate organisation, the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade has responsibility for state policy on the public procurement of goods and services. Despite the presence of the eProcurement systems described above, the Ministry faced a number of challenges related to them and did not systematically make use of procurement data to inform its public procurement policies. The problems experienced included:
  
*	Information on procurement procedures and contracts was difficult to retrieve;
*	Public procurement data had no standardised structure, making analysis challenging;
*	Lack of availability of transactional data;
*	Approach to procurement reporting was inefficient, unreliable and time-consuming;
*	Inconsistent data quality and duplicate data entries, driven also by the high costs of maintaining software, servers and hardware for multiple data repositories.

## Objectives and vision
Working with the EBRD GPA Technical Cooperation Facility, the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade aimed to modernise its public procurement system, ensuring it can draw on the data stored within its national eProcurement marketplaces to drive improved public procurement policies and decisions. It aimed to: 

*	Provide improved public procurement statistics to guide decision making;
*	Generate automated public procurement reports;
*	Provide transparency on public spending for citizens.

The EBRD-developed vision to achieve these objectives contains two primary points:

*	Implementation of an open contracting data standard (OCDS) transformation on existing eProcurement data;
*	Deployment of an OCDS-based set of business intelligence and reporting tools to enable analysis of public procurement data, and ensure transparency towards citizens and businesses.

## Technological solution and implementation

The developed solution extracts data from the existing eProcurement systems and converts it to the OCDS standard while allowing the legacy solutions to continue running unaffected. Once the data has been converted to the OCDS it is consolidated in one database. Two reporting modules – one for public authorities and one for the general public – have been set up, which access this data directly through an API. These modules allow users to analyse the eProcurement data and view it through a number of different angles and filters. The overall result is a publicly accessible contract register together with the business intelligence tools to dig into and analyse the contract data.

## Results and future expectations

As a result of the project, Belarus now has a national-level public procurement data analytical infrastructure. This system enables a previously impossible level of vision over procurement spending within the country, and enables various types of big data analysis.
In terms of the goals set for the project, the OCDS-based analytical system:

*	Provides transparency on public spending – through the online “Observer” tool
*	Enables the automated generation of public procurement reports – through the “Explorer” analytical tool 
*	Provides support for public administration regarding public procurement decisions – Government employees are able to use the “Explorer” tool to analyse public procurement data and guide their procurement decisions. 

Evidence that policy makers are making use of the Business Intelligence tools they now have to guide their decisions came with the passing of new legislation on how to deal with procurement complaints. The new system provided evidence regarding the inefficiencies of the existing review and complaints process for public procurement procedures. The new law reforming these procedures was passed as a result of having access to this data.

Going forward, the impact of the project could be increased by allocating resources and budget to training and outreach programmes to promote the use of the business intelligence tools not just within the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade, but in agencies and departments across the Government. The tools and spending data now available, could be used to guide decision-making not just for public procurement specialists but for policy makers across different policy fields.

### Impact: 

* Enables public procurement policy makers to take data-driven decisions; 
* Provides for the automated generation of public procurement reports; Ensures transparency of public spending.

### Lessons learnt:
* The underlying quality of the data is a key determinant of success  – impacting the costs of the data transformation and the accuracy of the public procurement statistics generated; 
* Projects should be designed in several phases, giving time for the government to make changes on the basis of the initial business intelligence tools developed; 3. To ensure take-up and proper use of the developed tools, a budget for training and outreach should be included.
